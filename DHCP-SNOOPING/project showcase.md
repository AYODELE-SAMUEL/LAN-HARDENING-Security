<h2>Conclusion</h2>


This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of **DHCP Snooping** as a LAN hardening security measure within a virtualized environment using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. By simulating real-world networking devices and configurations, the lab highlights how access-layer security can be enforced to protect against common DHCP-based attacks.

Through global DHCP snooping activation, VLAN-specific enforcement, trusted interface configuration, and rate limiting on access ports, the network is secured against rogue DHCP servers, DHCP starvation attacks, and man-in-the-middle threats. The addition of port security further strengthens the overall security posture by limiting unauthorized device access.

Overall, this repository serves as a practical example of secure network design, effective virtualization strategy, and access control implementation. The concepts and configurations demonstrated here are directly applicable to real-world enterprise networks and provide valuable hands-on experience for IT professionals, students, and cybersecurity enthusiasts.
